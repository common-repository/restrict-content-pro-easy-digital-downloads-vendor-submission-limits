Control the number of products a vendor can publish using Frontend Submissions for Easy Digital Downloads based on the membership level they have in Restrict Content Pro.

This plugin is an add-on for [Restrict Content Pro](https://restrictcontentpro.com/), [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads), and [Frontend Submissions for Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/frontend-submissions/).

Once activated, this plugin will provide a new option on the membership level add/edit screen that lets you control the number of products a vendor can publish.

== Installation ==

1. Go to Plugins > Add New in your WordPress dashboard.
2. Search for "Restrict Content Pro - Easy Digital Downloads Vendor Submission Limits"
3. Click "Install Now" on the plugin listed in the search results.
4. Click "Activate Plugin" after the plugin is installed.
5. Define your vendor submission limits in Restrict Content Pro under Restrict > Membership Levels.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How does the submission limit work? =
You define the limit by editing a membership level and defining the allowed number of submissions. The limits apply to each membership period. If a vendor has a recurring membership, that vendor's limit is reset to 0 when the next membership payment is made, allowing the vendor to submit additional products for the current membership period.

= Can I define a fixed submission limit that does not reset when a membership renews? =
Not at this time. If you'd like this feature, let us know.
